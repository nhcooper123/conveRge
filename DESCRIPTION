Title: Testing for convergent evolution in R
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Natalie Cooper
Maintainer: Natalie Cooper <natalie.cooper@nhm.ac.uk>
Description: Wrapper functions, and other simple functions, to allow users to test
    for significant levels of convergent evolution using multiple methods. I take no credit for the design of these methods, this package is just designed to make testing multiple methods on the same dataset easier.
